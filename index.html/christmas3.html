      <p>Our family might not be complete, but no matter what happens as long as we are still here, i'll always see it as complete.</p>

      <img src="images/myfamily1.jpg">
      <h2>One of the last few photos.</h2>
      <p>I still remember these photos, as it was our final moments until you were off to Australia, We were having a hard time believing that in a couple of days, we will no longer see each other for another 3 years. It was heart breaking, but we do understand that you did this for us and at the end it paid off.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="family-member">
      <img src="images/us.jpg">
      <h2>First time in australia.</h2>
      <p>You being away from us paid off, as we 3 managed to arrived at australia as well! This is only one of the few photos we have together because I was very stubborn and disliked taking pictures, and I regret it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="family-member">
      <img src="images/last.jpg">
      <h2>One of the last photos.</h2>
      <p>This is one of the last photos we have together, as we didn't have a lot of pictures together. This is when I decided move back to the philippines because I wanted to pursue my education there and not here.</p>

    <div class="family-member">
      <img src="images/mamaandnikki2.jpg">
